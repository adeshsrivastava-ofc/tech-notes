### 1. What is Secure Shell (SSH)?

[Explain what SSH is, what it stands for, and its main purpose.]

- SSH is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and manage remote computers over an unsecured network.
- SSH stands for “Secure SHell” and was developed as a safer alternative to older, unencrypted protocols like Telnet and FTP.
- Note: Don't mix it up with "SSL".
- SSH ensures that all data transmitted between client and server is encrypted, maintaining confidentiality, integrity and authenticity.

---

### 2. Why SSH is Important?

[Detail the significance of SSH in secure communications, authentication, and administration.]
<details>
<summary>**2.1) SSH is the backbone of secure remote system management.**</summary>

- Enables remote command-line access.
- Protects against eavesdropping, password sniffing, & data tampering during communication.
- Server administration – manage and deploy applications, databases, services, and perform troubleshooting.
- Secure file transfers (SCP and SFTP).
- Tunneling of traffic (port forwarding).
- Passwordless login – essential for automation and scripting in DevOps workflows.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**2.2) Supported across all major platforms.**</summary>

- Linux,
- macOS,
- Windows,
- Android,
- iOS.
</details>

### 3. How SSH Works & Versions?

[Describe the underlying principles, SSH protocols (SSH-1 vs SSH-2), and how the connection is established.]
> 📌 SSH is a ***”cryptographic”*** network protocol used to securely access and manage remote computers over an ***”unsecured network”***.
<details>
<summary>**3.1) What is an Unsecured Network?**</summary>

Ans) A network where data is transmitted without encryption, meaning the information being exchanged between devices can be read, intercepted, or modified by anyone who has access to that network.
- This means data, such as login credentials and financial details, is transmitted in plain text and can be easily read by malicious users on the same network.
- In simple terms, it is like speaking in a crowded room where anyone can overhear.
- Example :
  - Public Wi-Fi in cafés, malls, airports.
  - Home Wi-Fi without a password
  - Old protocols like Telnet or FTP.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**3.2) What is Cryptography?**</summary>

Ans) Cryptography is the technique of securing data, by converting plain text into cipher text, (using mathematical algorithms and cryptographic keys), so that only the intended person can read and understand it.
- In simple terms, Encryption + Decryption = Cryptography.
- Encryption = (hiding the message).
- Decryption = (revealing the message).
</details>
<details>
<summary>**3.3) Type of Cryptography?**</summary>

Ans) Two kinds - Symmetric Key and Asymmetric Key.
- Symmetric Key 🔑: Same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. Example: AES encryption (used in Wi-Fi).
- Asymmetric Key 🔑🗝️: Public key for encryption, private key for decryption (key pair). Example: SSH, SSL (HTTPS), Digital Signatures.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**3.4) Why Cryptography is Important?**</summary>

Ans) It protects:
- Your passwords when you log into websites.
- Your messages in apps like WhatsApp.
- Your financial transactions during online banking.
- Remote connections via SSH, VPN, and HTTPS
</details>
<details>
<summary>**3.5) Main Goals of Cryptography?**</summary>

Ans) Four main goals:
- Confidentiality – Keep data private (Encryption).
- Integrity – Ensure data isn’t changed.
- Authentication – Verify user identity.
- Non-repudiation – Prevent denial of actions (e.g. signed emails)
</details>

### 4. Use Cases & Real-Life Examples?

[List and describe where SSH is used, with practical examples relevant to different user groups.]

- It’s the go-to tool for system administrators, developers, and DevOps professionals to remotely manage systems without compromising security.

- Open Terminal (or you can press Cmd + Space, type Terminal, and press Enter).
- Run this command:
  ```bash
  ssh -V
  ```
- If OpenSSH is installed, you’ll see something like:
  ```bash
  OpenSSH_9.4p1, LibreSSL 3.3.6
  ```
